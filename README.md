Overview:

In this assignment, create a Word Guess game. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

Specs:

Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

Display the following on the page:
Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times the user guessed the word correctly).
Word Guess Area:
If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a.
Letters Already Guessed: (Incorrect letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word for the user to play.
